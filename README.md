# Robotics Roadmap — Learn Robotics the almost Free Way

This repository segment is for students who want to get into robotics for free. You only need:
- A laptop
- An internet connection

Everything else happens online using free tools and simulators.

---

## What you'll learn
- Design — CAD modeling with Onshape
- Electronics — Arduino and circuits with Tinkercad
- Programming — Python or C++ for robotics, AI, and ROS

---

## Picking where to Start (Step 0) 
Most of the time, this is the most crucial step of getting into robotics. Down the line one will require to be fluent in these domains, but one should always start with the one which they want to master. Choosing one and sticking to that domain is IMPORTANT.
   - Design: Computer Aided Designing, Simulation of Stress/Strain, Forward/Inverse Kinematics and Dynamics, Prototyping, Cost Effectiveness
   - Electronics: Tinkercad Circuits: Power Energy Systems, Control Boards, Sensors and Actuators, Communication and Network, Safety 
   - Programming: Robot Control, Embedded System programming, Perception and Processing using CompVis, AI Autonomy and ML Model Prediction

## Learning tracks (STEP 1) 
Once chosen the specific field, you can go ahead with these basic steps:  

### if choice == Design
- Start with Onshape: https://www.onshape.com/, free for all, just sign up with your email id, and start creating models.
1. Learn : Basics Tools and terminology
   -
   - Sketch Plane, Views, Creation of Parts
   - Intro into 2D : Sketching, Contraining & their shortcuts
   - Intro into 3D : Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft
   - Special functions : Draft, Hole, Fillet, Chamfer
2. Challenge : Build parts from Practice Drawing Sheets
   -
   - 
### Electronics (Tinkercad + Arduino)
- Tool: https://www.tinkercad.com/ (Circuits)
- What to learn: digital I/O, sensor reading, serial monitor, actuators.
- Practice projects: IR sensor with buzzer, ultrasonic sensor driving a motor/LED.

### Programming (Python or C++)
- Tools: https://code.visualstudio.com/ or https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
- Start with fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, modules, basic math libraries.
- Choose one path to explore deeper:
  - Computation and simulation
  - Machine learning and computer vision (OpenCV, Kaggle courses)
  - Path planning and robotics frameworks (ROS 2 Humble docs)

---

## Pick and plan your project

Use a short document (Google Doc or README) with:
- Team members (if any)
- Problem statement (clearly defined)
- Proposed solution and how the robot will be used
- Components or tools required (simulated/virtual)
- Milestones and approximate timeline
- References and resources used

## Cheatsheets

### Design checklist
- Sketching, constraints, shortcuts
- Extrude/revolve and creating 3D features
- Multi‑part assemblies and constraints

### Electronics checklist
- Transistors, LEDs, switches, pull‑up/pull‑down concepts
- Arduino UNO basics, sensors, and actuators
- Reading data in Serial Monitor and producing outputs

### Programming checklist
- Python/C++ basics: loops, conditionals, functions, modules
- Handling input from keyboard/mouse, simple visualization
- Math/science libraries and small project scripts
