# Robotics Roadmap — Learn Robotics the *almost* Free Way

This repository segment is for students who want to get into robotics for free. You only need:
- A laptop
- An internet connection

Everything else happens online using free tools and simulators.

---

## What you'll learn
- Design — CAD modeling with Onshape
- Electronics — Arduino and circuits with Tinkercad
- Programming — Python or C++ for robotics, AI, and ROS

# Picking where to Start (STEP 0) 
Most of the time, this is the most crucial step of getting into robotics. Down the line one will require to be fluent in these domains, but one should always start with the one which they want to master. Choosing one and sticking to that domain is IMPORTANT.
   - Design: Computer Aided Designing, Simulation of Stress/Strain, Forward/Inverse Kinematics and Dynamics, Prototyping, Cost Effectiveness
   - Electronics: Tinkercad Circuits: Power Energy Systems, Control Boards, Sensors and Actuators, Communication and Network, Safety 
   - Programming: Robot Control, Embedded System programming, Perception and Processing using CompVis, AI Autonomy and ML Model Prediction

# Learning tracks (STEP 1) 
Once chosen the specific field, you can go ahead with these basic steps:  

## if choice == Design

1. Learn : Basics Tools and Terminology
   -
   - Sketch Plane, Views, Creation of Parts
   - Intro into 2D : Sketching, Contraining & their shortcuts
   - Intro into 3D : Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft
   - Special functions : Draft, Hole, Fillet, Chamfer
   - Future Mastery : Assembly and Animations  
     
2. Challenge : Build !
   -
   - Drawing Sheet Assignments (will be shared on the group/workshops)
   - Create Basic Models from references : CAR, ROVER, ROBOT GRIPPER, CRANE LIFT, BULLDOZER ARM
     
3. Resources : (look into when you are stuck somewhere)

## if choice == Electronics
- Start with TinkerCAD Circuits: https://www.tinkercad.com/, free and opensource, sign up with your email id, and start creating circuits.

1. Learn : Basics of Components and Circuits
   -
   - Basic Components : LED, Transistor (NPN, PNP), Switches, Resistors, Timers and Clocks (555), Capacitors, Motors, Buzzers
   - Arduino UNO and Sensors : InfraRed, Ultrasonic, Touch, Switch (input sensors) combine with the components above to create output signals
   - IDE Coding & Serial Monitor : Switch to coding in C++ instead of block logic, Try output with serial monitor.

2. Challenge : Compete !
   -
   - Hardware Learning : Hands-on Learning, get components issued, build and prototype
   - Participate : competitions are open for al with resources provided, form teams and challenge others with your learned knowledge
   - Basic Circuits : LED Chaser circuits, LED Dimmer w/o code, IR/UltraSonic Based Range detector

## if choice == Programming (Python or C++)
- Programming itself has various subdomains, but for any programming purpose you do require the very very basic understanding of Coding (any language). Robotics usually utilizes Python and C++. Starting with Python is easier due to its readable syntax, but its better to understand both for future implementation.

1. Learn : Understand the Language
   -
   - Need to complete atleast Intermediate level of understanding of any language (proficient in Loops, Control, Keyboard/Mouse Interface creation, Library Integration and download
   - Code on VSC or Pycharm
   - Choose one (or more) subpath
      - Sensor - Actuator Integration (Beginner) : Loop system to control every nonde of the robot  
      - Computer Vision (Intermediate) : Camera feed with OpenCV, Cascading 
      - Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence (Intermediate) : TinyML, YOLO5, Ollama, HuggingFace
      - Path Planning (Advanced) : ROS2, Path Algorithms
      - Simulation Systems (Advanced) : Gazebo & ROS

2. Challenge : Project based coding
   -
   - Beginner Level
     - Write a program to simulate a robot moving in a grid (keyboard control).
     - Control a virtual robot arm with basic joint angles.
     - Simulate a simple sensor → actuator loop (e.g., “if distance < X, stop”).
   - Intermediate Level
     - Build a line-follower simulation in Python (using Turtle or PyGame).
     - Detect objects using OpenCV (color detection, face tracking).
     - Implement a basic search algorithm (DFS/BFS) to navigate a maze.
   - Advanced Level 
     - Create a ROS2 node that simulates a robot’s navigation.
     - Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in Gazebo.
     - Integrate a pre-trained ML model to classify objects from a camera feed.

# Pick and plan your project (STEP 2) 

- Once you have done basics of your domain, you can either start with another domain or go into project based learning. For domains such as Electronics and Design, one requires prototyping and hardware based learning. Socialize and form teams with like-minded people to start brainstorming and working on ideas.
- Once an idea is finalized : Start with documentation and proposal writing.
     - Start with any Google Doc storing the following data :
        - Data of students, Team Name (If any)
        - Problem Statement (properly defined) 
        - Your Solution, and how is it different (what is its use-case, where can it be utilized)
        - Components Required (pair with a spreadsheet/table : "Cost per unit" , "Quantity", "Buy link")
        - Milestones and Approximate time it will take to build the idea
        - Budget and Secondary Resource allocation
